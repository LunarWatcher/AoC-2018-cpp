# Note

This project is made in combination with my effort to learn C++. It's highly likely it contains inefficient and/or plain bad code. I might come back to the earlier days and optimize them, should I learn something later on I can apply, but there's no guarantee of that. 

For this year, there's also a [Kotlin version](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/AoC-2018) that's likely done before the C++ version.
